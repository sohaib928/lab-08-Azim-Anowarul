* General instructions:
- Fill in your name and GitHub username on top.
- Use the Notes section to add any notes to the instructor.
- The main lab description can be found here:
  https://maryash.github.io/135/labs/lab_08.html 
- *DO NOT ADD RESULTANT IMAGE FILES* - only add any source image
  file(s) you use.

* Daedalus specific instructions (changes from main spec):

This lab *will not* require unit tests using docctests. Instead,
create an image or images for each task. Name each image
appropriately:  taska.pgm, taskb.pgm etc.

You will have to set up the Makefile to create an executable name main
(remember, no required unit tests for this lab).

In this rep, you will find two files: *imagehelpers.cpp* and
*imagehelpers.h*. These contain the routintes *readImage* and
*writeImage* as described in the main lab file but with one big
difference. The versions provided  for you accept an additional
parameter - string representing the filename. See *sample-main.cpp*
and *sample-Makefile* for sample use.

* Extra files

- imagehelpers.cpp, imagehelpers.h - functions to load and save
  images. Similar to what is provided in the main lab but accepts a
  filename so you can load and save different images.

- sample-main.cpp sample-Makefile - sample to show the use of
  imagehelpers. Build using ~make sample-Makefile~. 

- inImage.pgm - sample image to start with.
